# Adult Income EDA and Classification Project

## Summary

In this project, we conducted a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) and built a classification model on the Adult Income dataset. The project encompasses the following stages:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** We explored the dataset to understand its structure, distribution, and relationships between features and the target variable (income). This involved analyzing missing values, summary statistics, univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis, and feature engineering.

2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** We applied PCA for dimensionality reduction to visualize the data in fewer dimensions. This step helped me understand the underlying structure of the dataset and identify important features.

3. **Classification Model:** We trained and evaluated various classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and SVM. The models were trained on the dataset and evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC. We also analyzed feature importances and coefficients for model interpretation.

4. **Model Validation:** To ensure the robustness of the models, we validated them using techniques such as cross-validation and testing on a separate validation set.
