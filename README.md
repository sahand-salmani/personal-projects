# Adult Income EDA and Classification Project

**Description:** In this project, I conducted thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Adult Income dataset, exploring its structure, distributions, and feature relationships. Subsequently, I built and evaluated a classification model using various techniques including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and a range of classifiers, ensuring model robustness through comprehensive validation methods.
**Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
